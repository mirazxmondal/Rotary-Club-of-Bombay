            Our Dear Rotarian Rusi Taraporevala willed amunificent donation of
            Rs 5.5 crores to set up a corpus at RCB for scholarships to
            deserving students for foreign studies. The MOU for this was
            signedby the gracious Mrs Jeroo Lam and her daughter Niloufer Lam.
            It all started with a call from Jeroo and Rtn. Nelum Gidwani to PP
            Ashish Vaid, and the MOU was drawn up, after many discussions over
            ‘sev puris’ at Willingdon. A big thank you to our Late Rotarian
            Rusi, Jeroo and Niloufer.

            The total amount raised by Aryaman’s school, The Cathedral & John
            Connon School in Mumbai, was Rs 32.26 lakh of which Aryaman raised
            more than 25 per cent and also the single highest individual amount
            raised for the campaign. When the pandemic first hit, Aryaman, who
            is in the 12th standard and am doing the International Baccalaureate
            Diploma Program, felt there was no way for him to contribute.
